# lofi_type_and_chill
ChillType is a cozy little web app that turns typing practice into a vibe. Type your way through random paragraphs while mellow lo-fi beats play in the background. Your WPM updates in real time, your highest score stays saved, and the interface stays minimal and relaxed — perfect for focusing, unwinding, or pretending you’re productive at 2 a.m.
